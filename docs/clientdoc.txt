We’re envisioning a system with the following features. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything, or need help visualizing what we’re looking for.
 
Tutor List
·         At-a-glance (eg, a list of all tutors with columns for the following info)

o   Name, email, phone, student(s), subjects, location

·         Detailed (eg, click on a tutor to see a page with more info)

o   Availability, Academic Director (AD), full address, student(s) with AD and subject, Interests, Learning Differences (y/n), bio, failed matches, notes

Client List
·         At-a-glance

o   Status (active, inactive, prospect, did not move forward), student name, parent name, cell phone, home phone, email

·         Detailed

o   Tutor / subject / AD, home address, location code, billing address, school, age, accommodations, referral, notes

 
Calendar
·         Should be sortable by tutor, subject, or AD.

·         Entries should include time, tutor, student, subject, and AD.

·         Expiring a lesson series should not delete all trace of it (eg, school year ends, but we want to be able to see previous months’ sessions).

HARRISON'S NOTES: 
-client wants the information to be easily copied and pasted
i.e. if it displays email, client wants to be able to copy and paste the text
-client wants consistent fomatting of each field i.e. for dates, only accept input
of type 5/19/14
-STYLE GUIDELINES:
 *2 space indents (replace text editor output tabs to 2 spaces)
 *try to adhere to most of these style guidelines:
